#Changes
All of the CSS changes were made in the 'grayscale.css' file.

##CHANGED
To help you find the changes, everything that I changed from 'black' to 'white' and vice versa, I used the CHANGED syntax, so all that you have to do is go into the 'grayscale.css' file and search for CHANGED: COLOR/LOGO.

It should look like this:
* CHANGED: COLOR || CHANGED: LOGO

Following that I added what the original code looked like.

If you have questions please ask!
