Services

I provide technology solutions for small businesses and individuals in the Portland area tailored around Apple products.

My services range from training in basic office productivity software to hardware upgrades and network design. It is not necessary to know your specific needs in advance. I will help you to discover the right devices for your needs and adapt them to your workstyle and lifestyle.

Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.

Philosophy

Information and communication are only one facet of our lives. Yet many technologists believe that we are benefited in maximizing both these in our lives. I take a different approach. Our phones ought not ring when we want to be left alone. Our inbox ought only notify us of a message when we are wating for it. Most of my clients are drowing in too much technology and my job becomes removing every part that does not serve or bring joy.

Rates

All of my work is done in-person at your home or business and I charge $80 per hour. I require a minimum of one hour for an appointment but I bill in 15-minute increments so there is no worry of paying for time unreceived.

Most on-site technical support ranges from 100 to 150 per hour. Why do I charge so little? On-site support involves a specific technical problem and a one-time fix. Most of my clients are not having technical problems as much as they are having technology problems. My clients prefer I take the time to know and understand how they engage with the technology on their desks and in their pockets and purses. Over several sessions we are able to adapt a solution that truly resonates.
